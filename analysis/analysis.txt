This is the analysis for Markov Part 2, Fall 2018

Include your name and net id here. Answer the questions from the assignment 
that are reproduced below

(1) Determine (from running Benchmark.java) how long it takes for 
BaseMarkov to generate 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 16,000, and 32,000 
random characters using the default file and an order 5 Markov Model. 
Include these timings in your report. 
The program also generates 4,096 characters using texts that increase in 
size from 496,768 characters to 4,967,680 characters (10 times the number).  
Do you the timings support the O(NT) analysis for BaseMarkov?



(2) Determine (from running Benchmark.java) how long it takes for 
EfficientMarkov to generate 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 16,000, and 32,000 
random characters using the default file and an order 5 Markov Model. 
Include these timings in your report. 
The program also generates 4,096 characters using texts that increase in 
size from 496,768 characters to 4,967,680 characters (10 times the number).  
Do you the timings support the O(N+T) analysis for EfficientMarkov?

(3)The tests in the class Benchmark use an order-5 Markov Model. 
Run tests that you think are appropriate to determine if the order of the 
Markov Model has a significant impact on the running time for BaseMarkov. 
Explain your reasoning.
